### Game Description

Inspired by the famed game Plague Inc., you start by choosing a disease to play and picking a country to start in. Depending on the attributes of your disease, it infects people in that country at a certain rate with certain symptoms. The simulation model will take into account the status of different countries (for example, the UK shutting down airports would make it less likely for your disease to enter) and determine how your disease spreads. Different “genes” which can improve infection rate, create fatal symptoms, or improve cure resistance can be bought as you infect people and earn “points”. As you progress and the disease and its symptoms become recognized across a sizable amount of people, borders shut down and the world starts to counter your disease with a cure. Your goal is to infect and kill the whole world before the cure is created and distributed.
