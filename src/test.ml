(** TESTING PLAN:

    Our test suite started off testing functions individually with "dummy" 
    virus, world, and upgrade values. Once we had our json parser and basic
    functionality, we moved on from a glass box testing approach to a more black
    box testing approach, where we used world, virus, and upgrade values with
    more abstract functions that would be directly used on them during the game.
    In addition, much of our testing later in development was through
    playtesting, especially for the functionality of server.ml, engine.ml, and
    the webapp.

    Modules tested by OUnit:
      country.ml
      virus.ml
      world.ml
      stats.ml
      upgrades.ml

    Modules playtested:
      engine.ml
      server.ml
      converter.ml

    This plan demonstrates the correctness of the system by ensuring the
    correctness of individual functions of the program on a small scale as well
    as testing certain modules in the context in which they will be used. This
    allows for smaller issues to be discovered with more precision and fixed
    more quickly, and for larger ones to be viewed in the context of gameplay
    itself.
