Our system has 1095 lines of OCaml code, including all of the modules we are
actively using, as well as the module main.ml. We wrote main.ml at an early
stage of development before we had implemented the webapp, and had intended it
to function as a form of rudimentary, text-based gameplay.It continues to hold
that functionality even though we switched our focus to the webapp, server.ml,
and engine.ml. We believe it is important to include because it allows for the
game to still be played at a basic level even if the webapp does not function.

Regardless of the presence of main.ml, our system has over 900 LOC that 
contribute to gameplay.
